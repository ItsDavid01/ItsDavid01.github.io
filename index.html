            The dataset "Accidentalidad en Barranquilla - víctimas" (Accidents
            in Barranquilla - victims) from datos.gov.co is crucial for
            addressing public safety concerns, transportation planning, policy
            formulation, research endeavors, community awareness, and resource
            allocation. By providing comprehensive information about accident
            victims in Barranquilla, Colombia, this dataset serves as a vital
            tool for understanding the frequency, nature, and locations of
            accidents, therefore enabling targeted interventions to reduce
            accidents and associated harm.

        </div>

        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            Analysis of the data facilitates insights into transportation
            patterns, infrastructure deficiencies, and factors contributing to
            accidents, informing the development and evaluation of effective
            policies aimed at enhancing road safety. Moreover, making this data
            publicly available raises community awareness about the importance
            of road safety and encourages safer behaviors while traveling.

        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            It's important to mention that with this project We could also
            identify and pinpoint high-risk areas, efficiently allocate
            resources for their prevention, and plan prevention strategies
            accordingly.

            The statistical insights derived from the dataset analysis reveal
            notable patterns regarding accident victimization in Barranquilla.
            Fluctuations in the quantity of victims over time suggest potential
            seasonal variations in accident rates, while the distribution of
            victims across different severity levels and types of accidents
            underscores the need for targeted interventions and safety measures.
            Disparities in victim distribution by gender highlight demographic
            considerations for safety initiatives, while identifying age groups
            most affected by accidents offers valuable guidance for tailored
            educational programs and preventive measures. Overall, these
            insights provide crucial information for policymakers and community
            stakeholders to formulate effective strategies aimed at improving
            road safety and reducing the number of accident victims in
            Barranquilla.

            Looking at the nature of the data and analyzing the information
            within it, we have come to the initial conclusion that with this
            data, we might be able to predict whether a person survives a car
            accident or just gets injured but stays alive.

            We have decided to use this condition as our model’s output, and for
            the inputs we have decided to take into consideration several
            aspects of the victim of the car accident, as well as some
            conditions regarding the accident itself.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>The inputs of our model will be the following</p>
          <ul class="lista">
            <li class="item_lista">
              <strong>CONDICION_VICTIMA:</strong> which describes, as stated,
              the victim’s role in the accident, for example, was our victim a
              pedestrian? Maybe a motor biker, maybe the driver of one of the
              vehicles involved in the accident. Etc.,
            </li>
            <li class="item_lista">
              <strong>CLASE_ACCIDENTE:</strong> which describes, as stated in
              the name, what happened exactly in the accident, a car crash?
              Someone getting ran over? Etc.,
            </li>
            <li class="item_lista">
              <strong>SEXO_VICTIMA:</strong> which describes the victim’s
              gender, male or female.
            </li>
            <li class="item_lista">
              <strong>EDAD_VICTIMA:</strong> which describes the age of the
              victim.

        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            Our desired output will be GRAVEDAD_ACCIDENTE, which can take two
            different values HERIDO (injured, wounded), MUERTO (dead).

        </div>
        <div class="parrafoDesc">

            Our general objective is to determine, whether or not, these inputs
            are sufficient enough to train a machine learning model and, most
            importantly, predict with certain level of error, out desired
            output.

        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            We have chosen logistic regression as our first model selection
            because we can see our output is a binary categorical variable and
            we believe this model to be fit for our current machine learning
            problem. As for the inputs, since we have both discrete and
            continuous variables we have decided to encode our non-numeric
            variables using the One-Hot_Encoding technique, which creates a
            column for each unique value our categorical variable can take and
            sets 1 to the corresponding column value and 0 for the others. We
            have also used a label enconding for out output column to transform
            the values HERIDO and MUERTO as 0 and 1 respectively
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            With this technique we have all our inputs as numerical variables
            and we are good to proceed with training the model.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            It is important to mention that we have also used a train test
            split, using, initially, 30% of the data for testing.

            Before training this model we had to clean our dataframe, since
            there was a small amount of rows (less than 100) with unexplicably
            high and unrealistic age values like 2024 or values above 100 which
            we believe to be not so probable to happen in our context, or with
            no especified gender. Hence the reduction in the amount of rows from
            our <a href="#origin_database">original database</a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            It is important to say that, initially there was a
            "another/not-especified" value for the columns "CONDICION_VICTIMA"
            and "CLASE_ACCIDENTE" and there were a few rows that made use of
            this values, but since the amount was too small and the parameters
            associated with these inputs showed to be not so significant when
            visualizing the coefficients of the model, we decided it'd be best
            to take them out of our final dataframe. This decision helped
            improve our R^2 score a bit, which we will cover in the next section
          </p>

        <div class="parrafoDesc">
          <p>
            As stated before, we used the R^2 score with the built in function
            <strong>score()</strong> to check the preciseness of our model
            against the test data from our train_test_split and we were left
            with a good score overall
